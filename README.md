### Required Libraries

- [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [numpy](https://numpy.org/)
- [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
- [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/) (requires matplotlib)

All fo the above can be installed using pip. Run the command
`>pip install {library}`

You will also need something that can run an ipython notebook. [Google colab](https://colab.research.google.com/), [jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org/) or [visual studio code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) can all do so.
I've not included the `match_data.csv`

Run each cell of `solutions.ipynb` from the top.
