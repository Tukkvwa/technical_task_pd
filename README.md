### Required Libraries

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn (requires matplotlib)

All fo the above can be installed using pip. Run the command
`pip install {library}`

You will also need something that can run an ipython notebook. Google colab, jupyter notebook or visual studio code can all do so.
I've not included `match_data.csv`

Run each cell of `solutions.ipynb` from the top.
